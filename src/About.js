        Hello! My name is N Sathyavathani, and I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Information Technology at KL University. I have a deep passion for technology and constantly strive to expand my knowledge and skills in this dynamic field. One of my primary interests lies in Java programming. The versatility and robustness of Java have always fascinated me, and I enjoy exploring its various applications, from building dynamic web applications to developing efficient backend systems. In addition to Java, I am highly interested in web development, particularly with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). This powerful combination of technologies allows me to create full-stack web applications with seamless integration and responsive user interfaces. My journey in web development has significantly honed my problem-solving skills, as I frequently encounter and overcome complex challenges that require innovative solutions. Whether it's debugging code, optimizing performance, or designing intuitive user experiences, I am dedicated to continuously improving my abilities and staying updated with the latest industry trends.
